        <p>Product description</p>
        <p>
            Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Website and
            are subject to change without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Products on this Website are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation
            on this Website through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colours, sounds)
            is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.
        </p>
        <p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
        <p>Purchasing process</p>
        <p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.</p>
        <p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order
                    by submitting it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Order submission</p>
        <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the
                    obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order
                    page.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal
                    information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation
                    for the User to cooperate accordingly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been
                    received.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by
            the User for such purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>Prices</p>
        <p>
            Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and
            costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.
        </p>
        <p>Prices on this Website are displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

        <p>Methods of payment</p>
        <p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
        <p>
            Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related
            information can be found in the dedicated section of this Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Website does not
            collect any payment information &ndash; such as credit card details &ndash; but only receives a notification
            once the payment has been successfully completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall
            be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or
            refused payment shall be borne by the User.

        <p>
            Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase,
            unless the User cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination specified in the relevant
            section of these Terms and/or this Website.
        </p>
        <p>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</p>

                    the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event shall the
                    Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners,
                    suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages,
                    losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the
                    preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and User,
                    whichever is shorter.

            This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable

        </p>
        <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,

            rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers,
            exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by
            applicable law.

        <p>
            The Owner&rsquo;s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver

            Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent
            reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms
            constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and

        <p>
            In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the
            applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular
            provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential
            to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they
            had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate
            into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

        <p>Exception for European Consumers</p>
        <p>
            However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a European Consumer and has their habitual
            residence in a country where the law provides for a higher consumer protection standard, such higher
            standards shall prevail.
        </p>
        <p>Venue of jurisdiction</p>
        <p>
            The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with

        <p>Online dispute resolution for Consumers</p>
        <p>
            The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that
            facilitates an out-of-court method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online sale and
            service contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, any European Consumer can use such a platform for resolving any dispute stemming from contracts
            which have been entered into online. The platform is&nbsp;
            <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">available at the following link</a>.
